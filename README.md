I drive a Chevy Volt. Great car. GM's restrictions and obfuscations around IP connectivity....not so great.

Use this script with whatever HA platform you want to get cool features like "Alexa! Remote start my Volt". 

Please share credit if used elsewhere - reverse engineering this was non-trivial. 

NOTES:

- Fixed nonces in use for the JWT/oauth handshake...will be fixed soon
